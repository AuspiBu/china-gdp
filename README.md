## Overview
In this project, I analyse annual GDPs of People Republic of China's provincial-level regions from 1992-2020 inclusive. 

Primarily driven by data visualisation, I will uncover insights about the dataset itself, such as distributions and patterns in GDP. Additionally, I will introduce an external dataset to enable further analysis. 

Please see the `china_province_gdp.ipynb` notebook for analysis and visualisations. The `additional_data.ipynb` notebook was used to scrape, load and export datasets that were additional to the base dataset. 

## Data Source
The base data is from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/concyclics/chinas-gdp-in-province?select=Chinas+GDP+in+Province+En.csv)**, with additional data being extracted from **[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)**.

**Please note that the data does not include Hong Kong SAR nor Macau SAR.**
